# linear-mixed-model-for-GWAS-analysis

This is the program to apply the linear mixed model for testing the correlations between cancer phenotype and generic interactions.

Due to the population stratification and sample relatedness issues, the regular statistical tests always cause inflation problems, i.e. 
there are lots of false discovery interactions. Recently, linear mixed models are widely used to solve this problem. In this program, we
apply this method to analysis our generic data.

# Installing
Just download all the files in your local pc, and run the code LMM_for_GWAS.R. We use a yeast data, which is included,to show the result.

#Running the tests
 You can run the code LMM_for_GWAS.R, and you will see some QQ plots. Some plots are also included in this repository.
